# Getting started

Coronavirus \(COVID-19\) is an unprecedented threat to public health and stability. In this rapidly changing environment, **the American public looks to government to provide reliable information and help**. One of the most important ways that a government can do this is by publishing accurate, up-to-date, actionable information. Having a website where you provide a single source of truth for reliable, up-to-date information is a great way to do this.

A lot of COVID-19 info is globally applicable, such as what is published by the [White House Coronavirus Task Force](https://www.coronavirus.gov/) or the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html). Your websites do not need to repeat this information â€” simply either embed these resources on your site or link to these sites.
