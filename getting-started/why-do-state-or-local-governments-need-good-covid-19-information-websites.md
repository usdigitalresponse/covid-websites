# Why do state or local governments need good COVID-19 information websites?

There is some information that is specific to states or localities, such as:

* Whether or not there is a Stay At Home order from the state.
* Who should get tested for COVID-19 and how.
* What local resources are available such as hospitals or financial help.
* Infections, testing, and tracking data that is specific to your locality.

The [Information to put on your site](../info-to-put-on-your-site/) section of this doc describes what types of information you should have on your coronavirus website, which is specific to your state/locality, vs. what can be linked or embedded from an authoritative source.
