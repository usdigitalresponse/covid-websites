# Infections & testing data

If your state or locality has data on testing, infections, and locations with outbreaks, surface this information on your website in a clear, easy-to-read, and visual manner. Ideally, you have some interactive graphs or visualizations that users can browse. For national and global data, there are many data resources that don’t require you to maintain that data yourself, so you can link to those. We recommend:

* [CDC - Cases in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html)
* [CDC - Cases in the World](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/world-map.html)
* [Tableau COVID-19 Viz Gallery](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/covid-19-viz-gallery): A curation of the those impactful data visualizations about Coronavirus \(COVID-19\) - from Tableau, an enterprise tech company that maintains its data and info really well
* [Coronavirus Global Cases Map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html): _\*\*_Interactive world map of COVID-19 cases from Johns Hopkins

**For data specific to your state/locality that you have on your website, you may want to include:**

* How many tests have been performed
* How many test results are pending
* How many test results are confirmed positive
* How many test results are confirmed negative
* Number of deaths
* Number of recoveries
* When the data was last updated \(example: `Last updated on April 4, 2020 at 4:00pm PST`\)
* We also recommend including a link to a page that has information about the data source, how it was collected, and its accuracy. As an example, “latest numbers” section of the State of California’s website links to [this page](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/california-covid-19-hospital-data-and-case-statistics), which has the data sources and descriptions.

_A great_ _example_ _of a government with clear, easy-to-read data about COVID-19 testing and infections is the_ [_South Korean national government’s site_](http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/)_._
