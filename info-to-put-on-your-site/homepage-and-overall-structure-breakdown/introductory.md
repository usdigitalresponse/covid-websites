* **Navigation** at the top makes the high-level buckets of categories very clear and easy to get to.
* **Search** provides an easy and quick way for visitors to find what they are looking for.
* **Definition of coronavirus** - Not everyone might know what coronavirus is yet, so state in clear, simple terms what it is.
* **Stay at home order** - if your state has a stay at home order, this is very important to call out prominently at the top of your site. Link to the content of the Stay at Home order itself.
* **When the site was last updated.** The coronavirus situation is changing very quickly. Letting your visitors know when youâ€™ve last updated the site helps provide confidence that the information is accurate and up-to-date. _The_ [_State of California_](https://covid19.ca.gov/) _provides a great example of where to put the_ _**Definition of coronavirus**, a notification of the_ _**Stay at home order**, and when the_ _**site was last updated**._
