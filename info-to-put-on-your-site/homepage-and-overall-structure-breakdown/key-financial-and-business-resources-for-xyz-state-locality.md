Clicking on each of these sections can direct users to a page containing links that pertain to those resources. [NYCâ€™s Coronavirus Information Portal](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/coronavirus/index.page) does this very well. They feature the resources prominently on their coronavirus portal homepage, and clicking on each link provides users with a page that has useful links, sorted by category.
