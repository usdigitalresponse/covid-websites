# Key health guidance

The majority of health guidance on symptoms, how to protect yourself, and resources for specific groups like travelers, pregnant people, etc. are largely applicable to all Americans. The CDC & the White House have been publishing and curating the authoritative, up-to-date content in this category.

[Coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov/) is the website that is created and curated by the White House Coronavirus Task Force. It links out to important pages on the CDCâ€™s website or other authoritative sources. The design of this page is also very simple, clear, and action-oriented. As this website is currently not embeddable on other websites \(we are working to see if this is possible!\), our current recommendation is to take the links from [coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov/) and to add those links to your own website.
